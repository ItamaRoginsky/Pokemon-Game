## Introduction

The Pallet Town Adventure Game is an HTML5 canvas-based game that combines exploration and turn-based battles. It features a player character that can move around a map, interact with boundaries and battle zones, and engage in battles with monsters.

## Setup

To run the game locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Game Components

### Sprites

The game uses sprite objects to represent characters, the background, and foreground images. The player character and monsters are implemented as sprite objects.

### Boundaries

Boundaries represent objects that the player character cannot pass through. They define the collision areas in the game.

### Battle Zones

Battle zones are areas on the map where random battles can occur. When the player character enters a battle zone, a battle sequence is triggered.

## Player Movement

The player character can be controlled using the following keys:

- W: Move Up
- A: Move Left
- S: Move Down
- D: Move Right

The player character's movement is constrained by boundaries, and it can trigger battles when entering battle zones.

## Battle System

The game features a turn-based battle system. Players and monsters take turns to perform attacks. The battle system includes attacks, health bars, and win/lose conditions.

## Audio

The game includes audio effects for map exploration and battles. It provides an immersive audio experience.

## Usage

To play the game:

1. Use the W, A, S, and D keys to move the player character.
2. Explore the map and enter battle zones to trigger battles.
3. Engage in turn-based battles with monsters using attacks.
